;This is the config file for Remote Commander. It is in .ini format because Qt supports that with very little effort.

[Devices]
;this section contains device definitions for each remote device.
;an arbitrary name for the device is the key, and the device interface type is the value.
;the arbitrary name is the name of the group used for more settings for that device.
;Available types are: samsung, lirc, mythtv, network, macro.

TvSerial=samsung
TvRemote=lirc

Onkyo=lirc

[System]
;A macro type device is a definition to map new names to a list of actions.
;multiple lines can be added to cause different commands to be run in sequence
;or to be toggled through. A /s<number> or /t<number> is added  to the command
;name respectively.
;/m<name> can be used to assign a command to only a specific mode. If no mode
;is assigned, the command will be present in all modes.

;the special <device>:setMode/<modeName> command can be used to set the mode for
;a device. each device has its own set of modes.

;Multiple macro devices can be defined with different names, to help divide
;commands into groups. Command modifiers like /s /m and /t are not specific to macros, and
;will work for any device type.

[Myth]
;The mythtv interface requires the IP of the frontend to control, and requires
;the frontend control socket to be enabled.
;take a look at http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Frontend_control_socket for details.
;requires a MAC address if you want to be able to use WoL support to turn the
;frontend on. the command for that is 'power_on'. to use power off, you need to
;set up a system event to respond to a key (I'm using F24) and make that system
;event shut down the box.

[Commander]
;The network interface is different from the rest, because it does not connect
;to a device, rather it provides a network socket that other applications can
;connect to.
;If you connect to this socket with netcat ('nc IP port') you will
;be greeted with a familiar interface, and be able to control all connected
;devices directly, in the same format as commands in this file.
